# Titanic-visualization-conditional-plots
Conditional plotting with a data set of the passengers of the Titanic.

The data set was compiled by Kaggle for their data science competition, called Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster. The goal of the competition is to build machine learning models that can predict if a passenger survives from their attributes. I am using the dataset with the data indicating whether the passenger survived or not, and creating conditional plots for analysis. 

Further work will include ML-related modelling to predict based on another dataset whether the passenger survived or not.
